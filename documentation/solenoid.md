### Wire configuration

**solenoid.py** is a test file for running the solenoid set up. Circuit diagram can be seen below. Pins are set up as follows:

| GPIO Pin    |  Colour         | Purpose         | Connected to
| :---        | :---            | :---            | :---
| 1           | Blue            | 3.3v power      | Top pin (C) of transistor (see CBE transistor pins - European)
| 6           | Orange          | GRND            | Grnd of breadboard
| 11          | Yellow          | Input port      | Button press
| 16          | Green           | Output port     | Middle pin of transitor (open circuit for LED/Solenoid activation)
